This project bridges data science, spatial analysis, machine learning, and American infastructure to prdict the growth of EV charging stations along fine-resolution raod segments of the American interstate-highway system. 

Temporal graph neural networks written using PyTorch Geometric (PyG) such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graphSAGE, and graph attention networks (GAT) in order to test on the data. 
8 years of data across 10+ features were processed in R using Simple Features (SF) and DPYLR packages while manipulated and manually checked using ArcGIS Pro.
